# Driver-Drowsiness-Detection-using-ML

Tiredness and Fatigue of drivers are among the huge reasons for street mishaps. Consistently, they increment the measures of passings and fatalities wounds 
internationally. In this paper, a module for Advanced Driver Assistance System (ADAS) is introduced to diminish the quantity of mishaps because of drivers exhaustion 
and consequently increment the transportation wellbeing; this framework manages programmed driver sluggishness recognition in view of visual data and Artificial 
Intelligence. We propose a calculation to find, track, and break down both the drivers face and eyes to quantify PERCLOS, an experimentally upheld proportion of 
tiredness related with slow eye conclusion.
